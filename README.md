# Vanilla JS Frontend Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of small projects built only using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The point is to strengthen my web dev fundamentals. It's also a nice reference for future projects.


## Project 01: Color Flipper

This mini-project is a simple color flipper. When you press the button the color of the page randomly changes, along with the button color.

## Project 02: Simple Modal Window

This one demonstrates a nice way to control UI visibility by adding and removing the .hidden CSS class. There are also some keyboard shortcuts. Its a good reference for a simple modal window.

## Project 03: Count Up Timer

This one is just a timer that counts up. Starts at zero and counts the seconds up forever. It has simple setInterval() usage and time formatting to make it look nice.
