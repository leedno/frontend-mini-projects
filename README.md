# Vanilla JS Frontend Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of small, focused projects built exclusively using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The core purpose is to practice and reinforce fundamental concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, CSS class toggling, and asynchronous actions.

## Project 01: Color Flipper (Completed)

This project demonstrates how to dynamically change the background of the webpage. It is a fundamental exercise in using Math.random() for data selection and manipulating the document.body.style property. It also features linking keyboard events to mouse events using button.click().
