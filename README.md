# Vanilla JS Frontend Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of small, focused projects built exclusively using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The core purpose is to practice and reinforce fundamental concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, CSS class toggling, and asynchronous actions.


## Project 01: Color Flipper

This mini-project teaches dynamic style manipulation by using Math.random() to select a random color value and apply it directly to the document.body.style. It’s a foundational exercise in connecting button clicks and keyboard inputs to change the visual appearance of the entire page.

## Project 02: Simple Modal Window

This mini-project demonstrates the correct way to control UI visibility by adding and removing the .hidden CSS class using element.classList. It practices robust event handling across buttons, the overlay, and essential keyboard shortcuts like the Escape key.
